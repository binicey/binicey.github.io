Hello! I'm Qinghongbing Xie, also known as David. Currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering (Intelligent Manufacturing && Robotics) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Intelligent Manufacturing Engineering && Artificial Intelligence from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/) in 2023. 

My professional journey features rich internship experiences in leading tech companies. At [Pudu Robotics](https://www.pudutech.com/) in 2024, I interned in the Pudu X Lab, focusing on the perception of humanoid robots under the guidance of Wu Xiang. Later that year, I joined the Machine Learning RD at [DJI](https://www.dji.com/), where I worked on the temporal consistency of video semantic segmentation. Currently, I'm interning at [Sensetime Technology](https://www.sensetime.com/) in SCG, delving into Smart City Spatiotemporal Reasoning LLM.
